**Course:** Database Management Systems · **Year:** B.Tech 2nd year · **Team size:** 4
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15 or newer · **Final submission:** Mon 23 Nov 2026
**Topics used:** Data types & constraints · Keys & relationships · Normalization · Query execution plans · Indexing · Query optimization · VACUUM/ANALYZE · Partitioning & sharding

## Files in this folder

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `README.md` | This project brief |
| `seed_data.zip` | 11 CSV files (300,389 bookings): the only input for Phase 2. Unzip it to get `seed_data/` |
| `queries/workload_30.sql` | The 30 queries for Phase 3 (do not edit) |
| `benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh` | Timing script: 3 runs per query, average, raw plans saved |
| `CHECKPOINTS.md` | Checkpoint dates and the files each one needs (DE and AP repos) |

**Getting started:** **clone this repository and push it into your team's DE repo** (the DE repo you submitted in the form); the steps are in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md). Keep the structure shown in [Repository structure](#repository-structure-submit-exactly-this). Unzip `seed_data.zip` inside your project folder, but don't commit the CSV files. Deadlines are in [`CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md). Then begin with Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Problem statements

BookMyShow sells cinema tickets **seat by seat**. A **venue** (PVR, INOX, …) has several **screens**; every screen has a fixed **seat layout** (rows A, B, C … with classic, prime and recliner seats). Each **show** is a movie playing on a screen at a time—and two shows can never overlap on the same screen. When a customer books, the chosen seats are held while they pay; a seat can be sold **only once per show**. Bookings include a convenience fee, optional food & beverages and offers. You have joined the BookMyShow data team (data covers shows from April to early July 2026).

The current database was put together quickly by an earlier team. It has **no documented schema** (only data exports survive), and the product teams are complaining:

| # | Problem reported | Team | Related queries |
|---|------------------|------|-----------------|
| P1 | "**Now showing, showtimes and search** pages are slow on Friday mornings." | Customer app | R01, R02, R06 |
| P2 | "The **seat layout** screen and **seat locking** are too slow, and two people must never get the same seat." | Booking engine | R03, W01, W02 |
| P3 | "**Payments**: the pending-payment queue, confirmations and seat-lock expiry jobs lag." | Payments / Seat lock | R09, W03, W04 |
| P4 | "Customers and support wait too long for **My bookings**, booking lookup and sign-in." | Customer app / Support | R04, R05, R22, R23 |
| P5 | "**Cinema managers** need occupancy, cleaning-gap checks and never-sold seats per screen." | Cinema operations | R07, R10, R17, R25 |
| P6 | "Partnerships' "**offers never redeemed**" report is always **empty**." | Partnerships | R13 |
| P7 | "**Distributors** want box-office and per-show ticket counts during release weekends." | Distributors | R08, R19, W05 |
| P8 | "Finance and insight reports (revenue mix, regional collections, ratings, loyalty, booking patterns, cancellations) time out, and volume will grow **20×**." | Finance / Insights | R11, R12, R14, R15, R16, R18, R20, R21, R24 |

**Your job:**
1. Rebuild a correct, well-constrained schema from the data exports (Phase 2).
2. Measure how the 30 most important queries perform today (Phase 3).
3. Make them fast **without changing their results** (Phase 4).
4. Prove the database will survive next year's growth (Phase 5).

**Deliverable for Phase 1** (`docs/01_problem_understanding.md`, at most 1 page):
- For each problem P1–P8, write in your own words what the business needs and which **stakeholder** is affected (movie-goer, cinema/venue manager, distributor, programming team, payments/seat-lock service, partnerships, finance, support).
- Classify each problem as **customer-facing / real-time** or **reporting / analytics**. This decides your performance targets later.
- List any assumptions you make.

## Phase 2: Work out the schema from the seed data

You receive **`seed_data.zip`**. Unzip it to get a folder **`seed_data/`** with 11 CSV files, a real export of the production data:

| File | Rows | What it contains |
|------|-----:|------------------|
| `cities.csv` | 10 | Cities |
| `venues.csv` | 140 | Cinemas |
| `screens.csv` | 490 | Screens (auditoriums) in each cinema |
| `seats.csv` | 94,056 | Seat layout of every screen |
| `movies.csv` | 300 | Movies |
| `shows.csv` | 160,034 | Shows (a movie on a screen at a time), 1 Apr – 7 Jul 2026 |
| `customers.csv` | 40,000 | BookMyShow customers |
| `offers.csv` | 25 | Discount offers |
| `bookings.csv` | 150,094 | Bookings (one per checkout) |
| `booking_seats.csv` | 300,389 | Seats sold in each booking |
| `movie_reviews.csv` | 32,510 | Ratings and reviews of movies |

Open the files yourself (a spreadsheet, `head`, or `SELECT` after a quick load into a scratch table) and study the data carefully. **Nobody will give you the CREATE TABLE statements.** Working them out *is* the task.

### 2.1 What you must identify (for every table)
1. **Table name and column names.** Use exactly the file names and CSV headers. The 30 queries depend on them.
2. **Data type** of every column. Choose the *right* type, not just `TEXT` everywhere. Think about money, timestamps with a time-zone offset, yes/no columns, small whole numbers, decimals and short codes.
3. **Primary key.** Is it one column, or a combination? (Look closely at `booking_seats`: what stops the same seat being sold twice for one show? What identifies a seat inside a screen?)
4. **Foreign keys.** Which column points to which table? What should happen **ON DELETE** (CASCADE, RESTRICT or SET NULL), and why?
5. **NOT NULL vs NULL.** Some columns are empty in some rows. Find out **when** and **why**, and decide which columns must never be empty. When are `offer_code` and `review_text` empty? Why does a cancelled booking have no rows in `booking_seats`?
6. **UNIQUE** columns (natural candidate keys such as emails, phone numbers, codes and handles).
7. **CHECK constraints.** Write at least **12** that the data obeys and the business needs. Look for formats (booking codes, row letters), allowed values (chains, screen types, seat classes, formats, statuses, certificates), time order, money rules (how `total_amount` is built from the other amounts), and a rule no simple CHECK can express: two shows on the same screen must never overlap in time (research PostgreSQL **exclusion constraints** with `btree_gist`).
8. **Relationships and cardinalities** (1:1, 1:N, M:N). Draw the **ER diagram** (image + Mermaid code).
9. **Normal form.** Show that each table is in 3NF/BCNF (list its functional dependencies). Point out any column that is *derived or redundant* (hint: `screens.total_seats` vs `seats`; `bookings.ticket_amount` vs `booking_seats.price`; `booking_seats.show_id` vs `bookings.show_id`; `shows.ends_at` vs the movie duration) and say whether keeping it is justified.

### 2.2 Rules for your schema
- Create every table in a schema named **`bms`**: `CREATE SCHEMA bms;` and `SET search_path TO bms;`
- In this phase create **only constraints**: PK, FK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK. **Do not create any other index yet.** (PostgreSQL automatically indexes PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE columns; that's allowed. Note which indexes exist.) Your baseline in Phase 3 must reflect a database *without* tuning.
- Your constraints must accept **all** rows of the seed data. If a load fails, either your constraint is wrong or you found a data problem. Explain which in your design doc.

### 2.3 Load the data
Write `sql/02_load_data.sql` using `\copy`, loading tables in the right order (parents before children):

```sql
SET search_path TO bms;
\copy cities FROM 'seed_data/cities.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)
-- ... the other tables, in an order that satisfies your foreign keys
ANALYZE;
```

Then verify the row counts match the table above, and run at least **3 integrity checks** of your own (e.g. "every booked seat belongs to the screen of that show", "`num_tickets` equals the number of seats held by an active booking", "no two shows overlap on one screen"). Paste the results into `docs/02_schema_design.md`.

### Phase 2 deliverables
- `sql/01_schema.sql`: runs top-to-bottom on an empty database without errors
- `sql/02_load_data.sql`: loads all 11 files without errors
- `docs/02_schema_design.md`: data dictionary (table · column · type · constraint · *why*), ER diagram, FDs and normal form per table, integrity-check results, and every data problem you found

---

## Phase 3: Run the 30 queries and record the time

The file **`queries/workload_30.sql`** contains **30 queries**: 25 reads (`R01`–`R25`) and 5 writes (`W01`–`W05`). They're also listed in the [Appendix](#appendix-the-30-queries). **Do not modify them.** If a query fails, your schema doesn't match the seed data; fix the schema, not the query.

### 3.1 How to measure (everyone must use the same method)
- Run each query with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` and read the **`Execution Time`** at the bottom.
- Run each query **3 times** and record the **average** of the three `Execution Time` values. Keep all three runs in the raw plan file.
- Write queries (`W01`–`W05`) must be measured inside `BEGIN; … ROLLBACK;` so the data does not change.
- Close other heavy applications while measuring, and use the **same laptop** for Phase 3 and Phase 4.

The helper script does all of this for you:
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh <your_database> baseline
# → benchmarks/results/baseline/summary.csv   (avg, median, min, max, scan types)
# → benchmarks/results/baseline/R01.txt …     (full plans of all 3 runs)
```
> ⚠️ One of the 30 queries takes **noticeably longer** than the others on the seed data. That's intentional. Let it finish, and don't skip it.

### 3.2 Deliverable: the timing table
In `docs/03_baseline_timings.md`, fill this table for **all 30** queries:

| **Total (sum of all 30)** | | | | | |

Below the table, add for each query the **scan type** from the plan (Seq Scan, Index Scan, …) and one line on **why** it is slow or fast.

---

## Phase 4: Optimize the queries

Make the queries faster. **The results must stay the same** (same rows; order matters only where the query has an `ORDER BY`).

### 4.1 Techniques you may use
| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| B-tree index (single / composite) | the right column **order** matters: equality columns first, then range/sort |
| Partial index | index only the rows a query needs (e.g. a rare status) |
| Covering index | `INCLUDE (...)` so the table is never visited (Index Only Scan) |
| Expression index | index the exact expression used in `WHERE` |
| GIN index | for `ILIKE '%text%'` (extension `pg_trgm`), arrays or full-text search |
| BRIN index | for huge tables stored in time order |
| Query rewrite | sargable date ranges instead of functions on columns; `NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN`; joins instead of correlated subqueries; keyset instead of `OFFSET` pagination; `UNION ALL` instead of `OR` across columns |
| VACUUM / ANALYZE | fresh statistics and visibility maps |
| Summary table / materialized view | for heavy reports that don't need live data (state how it's refreshed) |

**Not allowed:** changing the data, deleting rows, changing PostgreSQL server settings to hide the problem (e.g. huge `work_mem`, `enable_seqscan = off`), or caching results outside the database.

### 4.2 How to work
1. Put every index in `sql/05_indexes.sql`, each with a comment: **which queries it serves and why this type and column order**.
2. Put rewritten queries in `sql/06_optimized_queries.sql`. Copy `queries/workload_30.sql` and change **only** the queries you rewrite, keeping the `-- @R01` markers.
3. **Prove the results are unchanged** for every rewritten query (compare row counts, plus a checksum or an `EXCEPT` query). Put the proof in your report.
4. Benchmark again with the same method:
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh <your_database> optimized 5 sql/06_optimized_queries.sql
```
> 🔎 **Read the results, not just the timings.** At least one of the 30 original queries returns a **wrong answer** because of a subtle SQL rule about NULLs. Find it, explain it, and fix it. This is worth marks.

### 4.3 Deliverable: the optimization table
In `docs/04_optimization_report.md`:

| Query | Before (ms) | Problem found in the plan | Optimization applied | After (ms) | Improvement | Same result? |
|-------|------------:|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------:|------------:|:------------:|
| R03 | | e.g. Seq Scan on 300k booking_seats | e.g. use the `(show_id, seat_id)` unique index / index on `seats(screen_id)` | | e.g. 99% (90×) | ✅ |
| … all 30 … | | | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | | | |

Improvement % = (before − after) / before × 100

Also include:
- **Before/after `EXPLAIN` plans** for your 5 biggest improvements
- **Write overhead:** which write queries got **slower** because of your indexes, by how much, and whether that's acceptable
- **Index storage:** the size of each index you created (`pg_relation_size`) compared with its table
- **Queries you could not speed up**, and why (an honest "this query must read most of the table" earns marks)

---

## Phase 5: Scalability report (large dataset round)

Your optimizations worked on 300,389 bookings. Next year the business expects **20× the volume**.

By **Thu 19 Nov 2026**, faculty will release **`large_data.zip`**: the same 11 CSV files with about **20× the rows** (≈ 3,201,000 shows, ≈ 3,002,000 bookings, ≈ 6,008,000 booking seats, ≈ 1,881,000 seats, ≈ 800,000 customers). Until then, work on the design part of the report.

### 5.1 What to do with the large dataset
1. Create a new database. Run **your** `01_schema.sql`, load `large_data/` with your load script (change the folder name only), then run **your** `05_indexes.sql` and `ANALYZE`.
2. Run your **optimized** queries (`sql/06_optimized_queries.sql`). **Do not run the original 30 on the large data.** Some of them could run for a very long time.
   - R22 pages with `OFFSET`; if you replaced it with keyset pagination, explain how the "last seen" value is chosen for the large data.
3. Record the times and compare with your Phase 4 results on the seed data.

| Query | Optimized on seed (ms) | Optimized on large (ms) | Growth (large ÷ seed) | Meets target? | If not, what you changed |
|-------|------------------------:|------------------------:|----------------------:|:-------------:|--------------------------|
| R01 | | | | | |
| … all 30 … | | | | | |

### 5.2 Performance targets on the large dataset
| Query group | Queries | Target (average of 3 runs) |
|-------------|---------|----------------:|
| Real-time / booking path | R02, R03, R04, R05, R06, R09, R23, W01, W02, W03 | **under 5 ms** |
| Interactive cinema tools | R01, R07, R13, R17, R22, W04, W05 | **under 250 ms** |
| Reports and analytics | R08, R10, R11, R12, R14, R15, R16, R18, R19, R20, R21, R24, R25 | **under 5,000 ms** |

If a query misses its target, **find out why from the plan and fix it.** A query that was fast on the seed data can become slow on large data for reasons that only appear at scale. Show the before/after plans for every fix.

### 5.3 Deliverable: `docs/05_scalability_report.md`
1. **Results table** (above), with every target met or explained.
2. **Growth analysis.** Group your queries by how their time grew when the data grew 20×:
   - *stayed about the same* (why? e.g. index lookups grow with log n)
   - *grew about 20×* (why? e.g. they read a fixed *share* of the table)
   - *grew more than 20×* (why, and what you did about it)
3. **What broke at scale** and how you fixed it (plans before/after).
4. **Storage:** total database size, table vs index size, on seed and large data.
5. **Architecture for 100×:** explain with numbers from your own measurements:
   - **Partitioning:** which table, by which column (RANGE / LIST / HASH), and why. Write the DDL for `booking_seats`, show partition pruning with `EXPLAIN`, and note the primary-key rule for partitioned tables.
   - **Sharding:** Would you shard by city, by venue, or by show? A booking touches one show at one venue—but box-office reports span all cities. Which queries become cross-shard, and how would you handle them?
   - **Read replicas and caching:** which of the 30 queries you would send to a replica or cache, and which must hit the primary.
   - **Maintenance:** VACUUM/autovacuum settings for `booking_seats`, archiving old data, refreshing summary tables.
6. **Conclusion:** is your database ready for next year? What are the remaining risks?

## Evaluation (40 marks)

These 40 marks are the DE part of the project: **Query Execution (10)** and **Code Optimization (30)**.
The AP project (20) and your Individual analysis (40) make up the rest of the 100.

| Phase | Criteria | Marks |
|-------|----------|------:|
| | **Query Execution** | **10** |
| 1 | Problems understood, stakeholders and query groups correctly identified | 2 |
| 2 | Correct data types (1), keys and foreign keys with justified delete rules (1), ≥12 meaningful CHECK / NOT NULL / UNIQUE constraints (1), ER diagram + normal-form analysis (1), data loads cleanly + integrity checks (1) | 5 |
| 3 | All 30 queries measured with the required method: 3 runs, average (1), raw plans committed (1), scan type and reason for each query (1) | 3 |
| | **Code Optimization** | **30** |
| 4 | Speed-up achieved with appropriate techniques (6), every index justified (3), results proven unchanged (2), wrong-result query found and explained (2), write overhead and index storage reported (3) | 16 |
| 5 | Large-dataset results with all targets met or explained (4), growth analysis (3), scale-only problems found and fixed (3), partitioning DDL + sharding/replica design backed by your numbers (4) | 14 |
| | **Total** | **40** |

**Integrity rules**
- Every number in your reports must match the raw plan files in `benchmarks/results/`. Copied or invented timings make the whole phase score 0.
- Every member must have commits; the commit history is checked.
- You may use AI tools to learn, but you must be able to explain every index and rewrite in your individual analysis.
